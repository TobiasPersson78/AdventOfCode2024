# Advent of Code 2024

Solutions written in C# for the Advent of Code 2024 programming puzzle competition (see https://adventofcode.com/2024).

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

The solutions here are written in C# and adheres to these rules:

- No exception handling. This is not production code, so handling of corner cases or input not
  described in the task are ignorded.
- Code is written compact, but not extremely compact. This means a lot of chained LINQ expressions
  instead of `for`-loops, but variable names should still be descriptive.
- Few lines of code has higher priority than not having code duplication.
- The latest version of C# and .NET can be used, and preferably should if there's a suitable task
  that can use the new features of the language and runtime.
